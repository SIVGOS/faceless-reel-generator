# Roadmap — Reel Forge v2 (Quality & Polish)

Status: **planned, not yet implemented** (building in upcoming sessions).
This captures the agreed direction so any session can pick it up.

## Goals (from user feedback on v1 output)
1. Voice sounds mechanical.
2. Non-English words are mispronounced.
3. Captions just slide left→right (ASS `\k` highlight sweep) — want a polished,
   professional animation.
4. Video looks soft/flat.

## Locked decisions
- **Voice engine:** **Gemini native TTS** (`gemini-3.1-flash-tts-preview`),
  reusing the existing `google-genai` SDK and the existing AI Studio
  `GEMINI_API_KEY`. Keep `edge-tts` as the free fallback provider.
- **Caption engine:** **MoviePy** (pure-Python, MIT-licensed, lighter image) —
  chosen to minimize cost (no Remotion license exposure, no Node/Chromium in the
  image). **Remotion is the documented fallback** if MoviePy's fidelity proves
  unsatisfying; the timeline JSON contract (below) is engine-agnostic so swapping
  later touches only the render stage.

## Why Gemini TTS
- Same SDK + same API key already in use — no new account/credential.
- 30 voices, 100+ languages with auto language detection (helps #2).
- Expressivity via **natural-language director prompts** + inline audio tags
  (`[slow]`, `[whispers]`, `[excited]`) — the lever against the mechanical feel.
- Output is **24 kHz PCM, base64** (not mp3) → pipeline must decode to WAV.
- **Caveat:** no SSML / phoneme-level control. Tricky proper nouns will be much
  better but not *guaranteed* precise. The only precise fix is **Google Cloud
  TTS (Neural2/Studio) + `<phoneme>` SSML**, which needs separate GCP setup —
  kept as an escape hatch, not the default.

## Target render flow
```
prompt
  └─▶ Gemini script  (+ optional emphasis keywords)
        └─▶ Gemini TTS (director-style prompt) ─▶ 24kHz PCM ─▶ wav/mp3 + loudnorm
              └─▶ faster-whisper ─▶ word timestamps
                    └─▶ caption timeline JSON  (word groups + timings + emphasis)
                          └─▶ render engine (bg + Ken Burns + gradient overlay
                              + animated word-pop captions + audio) ─▶ reel.mp4
```

## Work breakdown

### 1. Voice — fixes #1 + #2  *(contained, ship first)*
- `app/services/tts.py`: provider interface; `gemini` provider via `google-genai`
  with a configurable **style prompt** + audio tags.
- Decode base64 24 kHz PCM → WAV (faster-whisper reads WAV directly); mux mp3 for
  the final.
- Add ffmpeg `loudnorm` (EBU R128) for consistent loudness.

### 2. Async rendering — prerequisite for slow renders
- v2 renders (Gemini TTS + whisper + animation engine) exceed a safe request
  timeout. Move `render_reel` to a **background job**; reuse the existing
  `projects.status` field (`pending/rendering/done/failed`).
- Frontend: poll `/api/projects` while anything is `rendering` (status badges
  already exist in the gallery).
- Start with FastAPI `BackgroundTasks`; graduate to a real queue (arq/RQ + Redis)
  only if concurrent multiplayer load demands it.

### 3. Caption animation — fixes #3  *(headline visual upgrade)*
- `app/services/captions.py` (new, **pure & unit-testable** like today's
  `subtitles.py`): group whisper words into 1–3-word on-screen chunks; attach
  active timing + `emphasis` flags (emphasis can come from Gemini keywords).
  Emits the timeline **JSON** contract.
- **MoviePy path (chosen):** stays pure-Python in the existing pipeline.
  `app/services/captions_moviepy.py` reads the timeline JSON and builds the
  animated caption layer — per-word **pop / scale-in** and active-word
  **highlight (accent color + scale)** via custom easing functions of time `t`,
  composited over the background. Heavy bundled font (Montserrat ExtraBold /
  Anton), lower/upper-third position. Renders via ffmpeg under the hood;
  invoked behind the same render-job boundary (timeout + error surfacing).
- **Remotion path (documented fallback, not built):** if MoviePy fidelity is
  unsatisfying, a `remotion/` Node project with `ReelComposition.tsx` (spring
  physics, rounded highlight pill) consuming the *same* timeline JSON. Adds
  Node + Chromium and a license check — see Risks. Deferred unless needed.
- Keep the ASS builder as a fast/lightweight fallback (`CAPTION_ENGINE=ass`).

### 4. Video polish — fixes #4
- Ken Burns zoom/pan on background; gradient/vignette overlay behind captions.
- Encode h264 high profile at `crf ~18` (vs current `veryfast`/`crf 23`).
- Optional `MUSIC_FOLDER_PATH` (mirrors `BG_VIDEO_FOLDER_PATH`) with sidechain
  ducking under narration.
- Provide higher-res 1080×1920 source clips (quality in = quality out).

## Planned config (env)
| Var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `TTS_PROVIDER` | `gemini` \| `edge` |
| `TTS_GEMINI_MODEL` | default `gemini-3.1-flash-tts-preview` |
| `TTS_GEMINI_VOICE` | e.g. `Kore`, `Puck`, `Zephyr` |
| `TTS_STYLE_PROMPT` | director-style narration instruction |
| `CAPTION_ENGINE` | default `moviepy`; `ass` (light fallback), `remotion` (future) |
| `RENDER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | cap for the render subprocess |
| `MUSIC_FOLDER_PATH` | optional background-music pool |

## Docker impact
- MoviePy: add the Python package + its ffmpeg/PIL needs — modest. No Node,
  no Chromium.
- Bundle display fonts (Montserrat ExtraBold / Anton) for captions.
- (Only if we ever switch to Remotion: +Node +headless Chromium, ~300–500 MB,
  `libnss3`/font deps + `--no-sandbox`.)

## Risks
- Per-video render time climbs → async + concurrency limits required.
- MoviePy animation is hand-rolled (easing functions) and tops out below
  Remotion's effortless polish; per-frame Python compositing at 1080×1920 can be
  slow — watch render time and cap concurrency.
- Preview TTS model (`*-preview`) IDs/behavior may change; pin and re-verify.
- (Deferred) If MoviePy fidelity disappoints → Remotion, which carries a Company
  License check (free only for individuals / for-profits ≤3 people) and a heavier
  image. Same timeline JSON, so the swap is contained.

## Open decisions (need user input before coding)
1. Background music: yes/no for v2.

### Verified facts (as of 2026-06-24)
- **The project's `GEMINI_API_KEY` is already on the paid tier** (free quota used
  up). So all Gemini TTS models are available — including the paid-only
  `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-tts` — with no extra setup, and no separate key needed.
- Gemini TTS uses the standard `google-genai` SDK + the same API key — **no new
  API to enable, no service account.**
- Pricing (paid): `gemini-3.1-flash-tts-preview` ≈ **$20 / 1M audio output
  tokens**; `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts` ≈ $10 / 1M; `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-tts`
  ≈ $20 / 1M. Default = 3.1-flash-tts (newest, best control); 2.5-pro is a quality
  A/B option now that billing is on.
- Rate limits are per Google Cloud project.
